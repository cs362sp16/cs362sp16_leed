When using Alex's random testers for the whole game, I noticed one bug
that a lot of people had in their dominion.c code. The feast card has
an infinite loop when trying to buy one card. Unless the player can get 
past the error checks, then an infinite loop can occur as the condition
for the while loop will never change, thus an infinite loop occurs.
