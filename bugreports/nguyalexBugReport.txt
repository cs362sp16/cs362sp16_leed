When using Alex's random testers for the whole game, I noticed one bug that a lot of people had in their dominion.c code. 
The feast card has an infinite loop when trying to buy one card. Unless the player can get past the error checks, then an 
infinite loop can occur as the condition for the while loop will never change, thus an infinite loop occurs. This is a 
high priority and severity bug as it can halt the game if the feast card is ever called. The solution to this problem
is to add an exit condition that lets the while loop, that causes the infinite loop, to be exited.
