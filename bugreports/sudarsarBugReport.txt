I was testing Ramcharan's unit tests and found a bug in one of the card implementations. For his cardtest1.c, he 
tested the smithy card, which had the bug. The smithy card is supposed to add 3 cards to the user's hand, but 4 
cards were added to the user's hand. When looking at his dominion.c code, I noticed that his for loop to give
3 cards had an extra iteration that gives the user an extra card. This is neither a high priority nor severity
bug as the game won't halt like the feast card function. I would consider this a moderate bug to fix as it would
give the player who uses this card an unfair advantage against other players. To fix this bug, the for loop could 
just be modified to give only 3 cards by setting i < 3.
