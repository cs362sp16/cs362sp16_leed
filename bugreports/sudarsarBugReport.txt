I was testing Ramcharan's unit tests and found a bug in one of the 
card implementations. For his cardtest1.c, he tested the smithy card,
which had the bug. The smithy card is supposed to add 3 cards to
the user's hand, but 4 cards were added to the user's hand. When 
looking at his dominion.c code, I noticed that his for loop to give
3 cards had an extra iteration that gives the user an extra card.
