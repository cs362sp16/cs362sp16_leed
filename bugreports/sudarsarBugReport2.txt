Another bug that I found in Ramcharan's code was in a card implementation. The salvager card is supposed to give the 
player an extra buy and also trash a card from their hand that is equal to its cost. His implementation in dominion.c 
does not give the player an additional buy, but the other functionality is there. I would consider this a moderate
priority and severe bug as the purpose of the salvager card is to gain an extra buy, which this does not accomplish.
This would be an easy bug to fix as the number of buys for the current player can be incremented up by one.
