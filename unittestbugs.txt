BUGS FOUND IN UNIT TESTS
	One major bug that I found by doing the unit tests on non-card implementations, was that the amount of players in initialize is not working properly. One of the parameters for a lot of the functions included which player I was referencing. I was able to initialize the game to 2 players, but was still able to pass in players 0,1,2 without breaking the code.

	The previous bug also affected how the scores were calculated. The scoreFor function was also able to take players 0,1, and 2. The scores for player 1 and 2 were both 0, but player 0 had a random score of 2. In order to solve this issue, I created an assertFalse function to catch these errors.

REPORT ON FINDINGS FOR CODE COVERAGE
	For the most part I was able to the coverage percentages above 90%. For the bugs that I found, I implemented my own assertFalse function to display what the error was. The functions and cards that I tested were mostly correct. The cards that I wrote unit tests for was the adventurer, smithy, village, and great hall card. The cards all were able to correctly remove and add cards to a user's hand. The cards that I tested also correctly added actions to a user's turns. 
	The code coverage went relatively well as none of the tests caught any segmentation faults and core dumps for any of the functions that I tested.
